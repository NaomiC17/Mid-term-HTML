<p style= "color: Gray"<h1> What are my Digital Chronicals?

</h2> <p style= "color: black">When we think about “digital,” we might often think about our phones and social media handles and what might be trending. It isn’t so far off; however, when I think about “digital,” my first thought leads to my camera, the pictures I’ve taken that only I have “created,” and the storytelling through imagery that I will convey to an audience, and to that, these are my “Digital Chronicles.”

<p style= "color: black"> I must agree with this at a personal level.

<p style= "color: Gray">For example, this occurs when the rain meets the sunlight.</p> <img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*1U9rqJd3TAwST3AqMoY75A.jpeg" alt="Sunlight Rain" width="600" height="300"> <p style= "color: Black">

<p style="font-family: Times New Roman"> <p style="color: black">Publishing this moment that day allowed me to share a moment of an unusual weather occurrence. It became a part of my life for quite some while; the way that I published my creative work was on Instagram. It allowed me to share information about the weather and put my creative insights to use. I was connecting with an audience who enjoyed photography and landscapes just as I did. However, in the future, I will be okay with publishing on websites such as Medium or WordPress. I prefer digital platforms to publish my works to reach a wider audience. However, thanks to the search engine and keywords, my work might also be shown through other algorithms across the web and media.

<p style="color: Black">Publishing, in this case, and perhaps in general, would mean not being able to receive feedback and contribute to the so-called audience in a more in-depth conversation. However, publishing through Instagram also welcomes the opportunity to use other digital handles or forms of online platforms such as blogs. Regarding my photographs, I have already done different photoshoots for people, animals, and landscapes. I suggest publishing or sharing the rights to the photographs with a copyright license suitable for other digital content such as articles, presentations, and other users and collaborations.

<p style="color: Black">I enjoy taking photos of anything beautiful to the eye at that moment. Primarily photos of color; There is a saying,

<p style= "color: black"> Publishing can be utilized in many ways. We break barriers and reach a more global audience by spreading content to others. We create forms for others that become more accessible, such as hyperlinks, multimedia, and content that engages users in reading experiences. Search engines allow our writing to be more information-specific and quicker; they are efficient, especially regarding cost. Digital publishing is much more cost-efficient than traditional print methods and distribution to a broader audience.

<p style= "color: black">This pro in this area motivates me further to publish my work digitally. Today, we must be interconnected with the outside world; it's accessible and efficient in receiving news and whatnot.  It motivates me to contribute to a broad audience in the area I focus on posting. We share knowledge and understanding, and this is important. Digital publishing provides opportunities to experiment with the expression that engages and allows us to explore innovative forms of storytelling, all while communicating to even a global audience.

<H1 style= "color: black;font-family: Courier New;"> My experience with HMTL</h1>

<p style= "color:black;font-family:Courier New;"> By Naomi Carrillo

<div style="color: black; font-family: Courier New;"> To begin with, I would like to add that I used <p> H3 HMTL Editor Guide 
<ahref="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_body.asp"
target="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_body.asp">Visit W3schools</a>

<div style="color: black; font-family: Courier New;"> This guide has a variety of catalogs with different categories of elements, attributes, and overall codes that are helpful in learning the markup language. This resource proves invaluable in offering a rich repository to both beginners and knowledgeable developers. Exploring this extensive catalog will deepen your understanding and enhance your proficiency in the markup language."

<div style="color: black; font-family: Courier New;"> Initially, I struggled to do more besides the paragraphs; I needed to know how to "play" with my writing on here just as I would with any other app that did it for me, like the Word application. 
- So, I scribbled my random thoughts with the essential elements from the catalog into an app called "Markdown Editor" on Mac. I would leave what I had on this app while watching to the side how my "website" was getting developed, adding every essential element to see the difference and going back and forth to "play" around with it to see what changes and how it changes. 

<p><div style="color: black; font-family: Courier New;"> As I got the basics of elements down, I also played around with the attributes. These add additional information to an HTML element and always have an opening tag for the element. From what I'm aware, they start with a name and a value and are finally separated by an equal sign and enclosed once again by double or single quotes. This all helps to modify or provide any details about the elements. 

<p> <div style="color: black; font-family: Courier New;"> Sometimes, I would add one attribute with one element, and it did not help in getting the outcome that I looked for. For example, I was adding a paragraph, plus letter color, plus a different font style, and having to separate it without it all looking so mushed together. This was the complicated part because sometimes, adding it together as how I thought in mind was not correct. So, I'd have to return to the guide and correct it. However, it is very easy to type over something accidentally or miss typing something that should have been between the attribute and element, such as an equal sign, a quote, etc.
